### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

i am Daniel software developer, student and husband from Dresden Germany. My passion is to explore the new hot shit in digitalism to improve my daily digital life. One of my favourit developing task is to create [Citavi](https://www.github.com/citavi) addons to improve the customer experience. Right after my work for Swiss Academic Software i am interested in reading books and hearing podcast. For german developers i can recommend the [DevCouch](https://www.cdevocuh.de) podcast.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure security best practices
- ðŸ¤– Best computer game is the very old Escape from Delirium a point-and-click adventure from the 90`th. with the right portion of sarkasm and dark humor.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first steps i made on an old pc with an intel i486 66 MHz prozessor who had an hardware switch to reduce the cpu speed. Otherwise the computer was to fast to play Pacman.
